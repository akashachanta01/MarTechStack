Hi there,

You're officially confirmed! 

You will now receive instant alerts whenever a new Marketing Operations or MarTech role is posted on MarTechStack.io.

We curate for quality, so you won't get spammed with irrelevant "Digital Marketing" or "Social Media" roles—only the technical stuff.

Best,
The MarTechStack Team
